I have an opportunity to visit South America last year during the Christmas break. To be honest, I was not very keen to travel at the beginning because my work schedule had been quite packed with multiple deadlines. Personally, I would have preferred a quiet Christmas break at home, without the travel hustle to transit at different countries. Nevertheless, as I have promised my family to travel together, I kept my promises to backpack in South and Central America (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Panama) for about three weeks.

Well, I am glad that I did make the trip and certainly did not regret the decision to travel. In fact, the highlight of my trips was the visit to the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador, which are avolcanic archipelago renowned for their unique biodiversity in the Pacific Ocean. Home to species like giant tortoises, iguanas, blue-footed boobies and sea lions, I was completely captivated by the remarkable wildlife and landscape I saw in the Galápagos Islands. The archipelago consists of 13 major islands and 6 smaller islands. We visited the four main islands (Baltra, Santa Cruz, Isabella and San Cristóbal) and spotted many special species.

In Galápagos, we did not see many cats and dogs on the streets, but sea lions. They are indeed playful mammals that can often be seen lounging on the benches, streets, beaches and beside the bicycles!

    I was very lucky to have spotted the sea lion in the same frame as the blue-footed booby. Well, the blue-footed boobies are given this name because of their blue feet.

My best experience was snorkeling around the Isla Pinzon. It is a small and uninhabited island in the Galápagos Islands. We did not take expensive cruise, but instead booked a local tour from Puerto Ayora to visit Isla Pinzon with a professional local naturalist. The water was crystal clear and I felt as if I was snorkeling in a paradise with a GoPro camera. I was really happy shooting photos and videos of many fishes and sea turtles underwater. And guess what, I was even lucky enough to spot the different type of shark species in their natural habitats! For example, the white-tipped reef sharks like to sleep on the bottom and in caves. These sharks are not dangerous as they feed on small fishes at night. Nevertheless, we were advised by professional divers to be prudent when approaching the sharks without exhibiting any kind of threatening or agitating behavior in their space.

The Galápagos giant tortoise is one of the most famous animals. In fact, the islands are being named after them, as _Galápago_ is an old Spanish word for tortoise. Fun fact: these tortoises weigh more than 250kg and can live more than 100 years! While they feed on grasses, they also eat cactus pads for food. Interestingly, to withstand grazing by the tortoises, the cacti also grew taller and taller with thicker and woody trunks.

    The local villagers showed us around the Santa Cruz highlands to see the gigantic tortoises. The cacti in the Galápagos Islands also have unusual size, as you can see from the picture on the right. Both of the giant tortoises and cacti have coexisted for hundreds of years, demostrating a unique example of plant-animal interaction in the Galápagos Islands.
