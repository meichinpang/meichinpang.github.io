I was very grateful to be selected as a JSPS Fellow to visit Japan for about 3 months, and I chose to work on Responsible AI for my fellowship research topic at the Tohoku University. During my research fellowship in Japan, I was invited by my host professor to give a seminar at the department on different applications of AI for battery research. Well, a few other professors and their students from other groups also came to attend the talk. After I finished explaining the differences between supervised machine-learning, unsupervised machine-learning and reinforcement learning with selected relevant applications for battery research, one Japanese professor invited me to meet him in his office afterward.

This Japanese professor, who is also the head of the research group, is in his 60s. I was concerned whether the discussion of AI might make him feel uncomfortable. This is because some people have told me prior to my visit in Japan about the hierarchical system in Japanese education and that older generations might not be opened to new technologies like AI.

To be honest, I was very surprised to learn his responses to our AI discussions during the talk. He printed out several papers with different diagrams and asked me whether these research problems could be solved by AI. He went on to explain how he learned about reinforcement learning from Alpha Go and was enthusiastic that AI is also applicable for battery applications! At that point, all the bias I have heard from others just shattered in his office after the discussion.

I was even surprised the next few days when he ordered several books on programming and AI in Japanese language for his students, and encouraged them to study the books for their future. If all the biases I have heard previously are true, these professors should be concerned about the advancement of AI in battery research. Undoubtedly, AI might make some works redundant and obsolete, for example, through AI-driven automation in battery manufacturing and testing. However, I see a completely different response from these professors. Instead of worrying about the possibility of AI replacing some tasks in their research, they asked, “How can we adapt to keep up with future applications of AI in our lines of work?”

There were no generational gaps, cultural differences or communication barriers in our meetings. Instead, we were exploring different possibilities to combine experimental expertise with AI to do cutting-edge research together.

I am really proud of my professors in Japan. Their responses towards AI adoption should be an example for all to follow. The future is AI, and yes, sometimes it may sound scary to some of us, but I believe that each of us could contribute towards making AI accessible, effective and safe for all.

Most AI researchers usually use Python for different machine-learning applications, but I came across this book about Julia at the local book store of the Tohoku University. Like Python, Julia also provides powerful libraries such as `Flux.jl` and `MLJ.jl`, which enables fast model training and deep learning with automatic differentiation. While I am very comfortable with using Python, I am opened to learning Julia as my next programming language, just like my Japanese professors, who are opened to adopting AI in their research.
