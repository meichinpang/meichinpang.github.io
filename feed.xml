During my research fellowship in Japan, I was invited by my host professor to give a seminar at the department on different applications of AI for battery research. Well, a few other professors and their students from other groups also came to attend the talk. After I finished explaining the differences between supervised machine-learning, unsupervised machine-learning and reinforcement learning with selected relevant applications for battery research, one Japanese professor invited me to meet him in his office afterward.</p> <p>This Japanese professor, who is also the head of the research group, is in his 60s. I was concerned whether the discussion of AI might make him feel uncomfortable. This is because some people have told me prior to my visit in Japan about the hierarchical system in Japanese education and that older generations might not be opened to new technologies like AI.</p> <p>To be honest, I was very surprised to learn his responses to our AI discussions during the talk. He printed out several papers with different diagrams and asked me whether these research problems could be solved by AI. He went on to explain how he learned about reinforcement learning from Alpha Go and was enthusiastic that AI is also applicable for battery applications! At that point, all the bias I have heard from others just shattered in his office after the discussion.</p> <p>I was even surprised the next few days when he ordered several books on programming and AI in Japanese language for his students, and encouraged them to study the books for their future. If all the biases I have heard previously are true, these professors should be concerned about the advancement of AI in battery research. Undoubtedly, AI might make some works redundant and obsolete, for example, through AI-driven automation in battery manufacturing and testing. However, I see a completely different response from these professors. Instead of worrying about the possibility of AI replacing some tasks in their research, they asked, “How can we adapt to keep up with future applications of AI in our lines of work?”</p> <p>There were no generational gaps, cultural differences or communication barriers in our meetings. Instead, we were exploring different possibilities to combine experimental expertise with AI to do cutting-edge research together.</p> <p>I am really proud of my professors in Japan. Their responses towards AI adoption should be an example for all to follow. The future is AI, and yes, sometimes it may sound scary to some of us, but I believe that each of us could contribute towards making AI accessible, effective and safe for all.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/julia_book-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/julia_book-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/julia_book-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/julia_book.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="500" height="600" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Most AI researchers usually use Python for different machine-learning applications, but I came across this book about Julia at the local book store of the Tohoku University.

To be honest, I was not very keen to travel at the beginning because my work schedule had been quite packed with multiple deadlines. Personally, I would have preferred a quiet Christmas break at home, without the travel hustle to transit at different countries. Nevertheless, as I have promised my family to travel together, I kept my promises to backpack in South and Central America (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Panama) for about three weeks.</p> <p>Well, I am glad that I did make the trip and certainly did not regret the decision to travel. In fact, the highlight of my trips was the visit to the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador, which are avolcanic archipelago renowned for their unique biodiversity in the Pacific Ocean. Home to species like giant tortoises, iguanas, blue-footed boobies and sea lions, I was completely captivated by the remarkable wildlife and landscape I saw in the Galápagos Islands. The archipelago consists of 13 major islands and 6 smaller islands. We visited the four main islands (Baltra, Santa Cruz, Isabella and San Cristóbal) and spotted many special species.</p> <p>In Galápagos, we did not see many cats and dogs on the streets, but sea lions. They are indeed playful mammals that can often be seen lounging on the benches, streets, beaches and beside the bicycles!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sea_lion-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sea_lion-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sea_lion-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/sea_lion.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/boobies-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/boobies-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/boobies-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/boobies.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> I was very lucky to have spotted the sea lion in the same frame as the blue-footed booby. Well, the blue-footed boobies are given this name because of their blue feet. </div> <p>My best experience was snorkeling around the Isla Pinzon. It is a small and uninhabited island in the Galápagos Islands. We did not take expensive cruise, but instead booked a local tour from Puerto Ayora to visit Isla Pinzon with a professional local naturalist. The water was crystal clear and I felt as if I was snorkeling in a paradise with a GoPro camera. I was really happy shooting photos and videos of many fishes and sea turtles underwater. And guess what, I was even lucky enough to spot the different type of shark species in their natural habitats! For example, the white-tipped reef sharks like to sleep on the bottom and in caves. These sharks are not dangerous as they feed on small fishes at night. Nevertheless, we were advised by professional divers to be prudent when approaching the sharks without exhibiting any kind of threatening or agitating behavior in their space.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sea_turtle-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/sea_turtle-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/sea_turtle-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/sea_turtle.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/sharks.PNG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/sharks.PNG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> These photos were taken with a GoPro camera while snorkelling in Isabella and San Cristóbal. </div> <p>The Galápagos giant tortoise is one of the most famous animals.

While they feed on grasses, they also eat cactus pads for food. Interestingly, to withstand grazing by the tortoises, the cacti also grew taller and taller with thicker and woody trunks.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/giant_tortoise-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/giant_tortoise-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/giant_tortoise-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/giant_tortoise.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/giant_cactus-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/giant_cactus-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/giant_cactus-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/giant_cactus.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The local villagers showed us around the Santa Cruz highlands to see the gigantic tortoises.
